# PRIME FACTORIZATION FOR LARGE NUMBERS
This program will factorize large numbers into prime numbers using known algorithms to perform such work.

By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, every positive integer has a unique prime factorization.

Given a general algorithm for integer factorization, any integer can be factored into its constituent prime
factors by repeated application of this algorithm.
