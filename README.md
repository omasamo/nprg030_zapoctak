# PRIME FACTORIZATION FOR LARGE NUMBERS
This program will factorize large numbers into prime numbers using known algorithms to perform such work.
By the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, every positive integer has a unique prime factorization.
Given a general algorithm for integer factorization, any integer can be factored into its constituent prime factors by repeated application of this algorithm. The situation is more complicated with special-purpose factorization algorithms, whose benefits may not be realized as well or even at all with the factors produced during decomposition.

#USAGE
User will be asked to to give the number for which he would like to see his prime roots.
In the case of no prime root, we would consider given number itself as a prime number.

#IMPLEMENTATION
We are using Rho method discovered by J.M. Pollard which is using the fact randmization of possible results can be verz efficient method of factorization.
